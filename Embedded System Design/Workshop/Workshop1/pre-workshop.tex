\section*{Question 1}
Distance measuring range: 20 to 150 cm

\section*{Question 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
0.4-2.45 V \\
Typical output at 150cm: 0.4V \\
Typical output voltage differenctial between 20-150 cm: 2.05 V \\
From figure 3, V(20cm) > V(150cm). \\
Typical output at 20cm: 0.4+2.05 = 2.45 V
\subsection*{(b)}
The measurements in data-sheet are for reference only. We need to consider noises from the environment and measurements.
Different environments and measuring equiments may vary the performence of the sensor.
