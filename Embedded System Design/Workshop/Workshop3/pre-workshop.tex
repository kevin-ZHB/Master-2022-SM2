\section*{Question 1}
Distance measuring range: 10 to 80 cm

\section*{Question 2}
\subsection*{(a)}
0.4-2.45 V \\
Typical output at 80 cm: 0.4V \\
Typical output voltage differenctial between 10-80 cm: 1.9 V \\
Typical output at 10cm: 0.4+1.9 = 2.3 V
\subsection*{(b)}
The measurements in data-sheet are for reference only. We need to consider noises from the environment and measurements.
Different environments and measuring equiments may vary the performence of the sensor.
